By inserting a number in the textfield and clicking on generate, the specified number of points are generated. 
By then clicking on solve, the minimum enclosing circle is computed and visualized. 
In the command line, the resulting circle and the runtime for both the msw and the naive algorithm is printed.
By clicking on generate and solve, both steps can be executed in a single step.
By clicking on the canvas, a single point is added.
In the visualization, the green circles correspond to intermediate results and the pink circle to the final result.
